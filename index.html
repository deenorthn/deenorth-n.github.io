    <h2>SEO and SMO Techniques</h2>
    <div id="seo-smo-content">
        <p>One effective SEO technique is using meta descriptions. Meta descriptions provide a brief summary of a webpage's content and often appear in search engine results pages, helping users decide which link to click (Backlinko, 2023).</p>
        <p>Another SEO method is optimizing page titles. Including keywords in page titles improves the likelihood of a webpage ranking higher in search results (SE Ranking, 2023).</p>
        <p>Ensuring all images have meaningful alt text enhances accessibility and contributes to better SEO by incorporating keywords (Neilson Marketing Services, 2023).</p>
        <p>For SMO, integrating social media buttons increases visibility and encourages user interaction, boosting engagement (Barker, 2022).</p>
        <p>Leveraging hashtags on platforms like Instagram expands reach and connects with broader audiences (Lockard, 2023).</p>
        <p>Lastly, creating shareable and engaging content fosters community participation and drives traffic from social media platforms (Clay, 2023).</p>
